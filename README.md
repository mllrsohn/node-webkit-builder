     }
   }
   ```
2. Create a build script

   // scripts/build.js
   const { nwbuild } = require("nw-builder");
   await nwbuild({
     srcDir: "./nwapp/**/* ./other/**/*.js",
     mode: "build",
     version: "latest",
     flavor: "normal",
     platform: "linux",
     arch: "x64",
     outDir: "./build",
     cache: false,
     app: { ... },
   });
   ```
3. Run the script

   ```
